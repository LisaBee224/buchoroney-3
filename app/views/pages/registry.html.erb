  <h3>I'll light the fire, while you place the flowers in the vase that you bought today</h3>
  <p>Please note that you are not, by any means obligated to get us anything! Your company and good cheer on the 16th mean the world to us, and that's really all we ask for!</p>

  <p>However, if you would like to gift us anything and need some suggestions we will have a registry up soon, so check back later!</p>
